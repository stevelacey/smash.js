Smash.js simply scrapes Smashing Magazine by guessing the 301 URL to their latest monthly wallpaper article. It then grabs the URL's to the largest resolution 'without calendar' wallpapers, falling back to 'with calendar' if none are provided.

The latest wallpapers are thrown into the 'wallpapers/Current' directory, old wallpapers are archived by date format 'YYYY-MM'.

These scripts are designed to be ran on a monthly cron, I execute them in the early hours on the first of every month.


NB: This used to push out to Dropbox using the Ruby, some breaking changes were made to the gem and I've opted to just symlink the wallpapers directory into my Dropbox which I have running on my server, decoupling this I feel adds more flexability.
